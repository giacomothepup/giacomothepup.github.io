			 Akira Matcha 30g - Organic Premium Ceremonial Japanese Matcha Green Tea Powder - First Harvest - Zero Sugar - USDA and JAS Certified</span></p>
		 <p><span class="subhead">Shade grown for three weeks</span><br>
Shading prior to harvest will block the majority of sun light. This is a traditional step in creating matcha with a direct impact on flavor and quality.</p>
		 <p><span class="subhead">Carefully selected leaves</span><br>
This matcha is made from delicate first harvest leaves from the top of the tea plants.</p>
		 <p><span class="subhead">Slowly stone ground</span><br>
After removing the stems and veins, tencha will be carefully ground to matcha by stone mills. The grinding process is slow enough to avoid creating excessive heat that could affect the quality of the powder.</p>
		 <p><span class="subhead">Fresh matcha year-round</span><br>
Semi-processed leaves are stored in temperature controlled units. Those leaves will be processed and ground to matcha in small batches, as needed, which allows for freshly ground matcha through out the year.</p>
